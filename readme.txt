                                    Encapsultion
                                        is hiding pieces of functionality and making it unavailable to the rest of the code base. It is a form of data protection, so that data cannot be manipulated or changed without obvious intention. 
                                    Polymorphism
                                        is the ability for different types of data to respond to a common interface.
                                    Inheritance
                                        via mixins/modules
                                        via parent classes
                                    Class vs Object
                                        class = the definition, the "mold"
                                        object = the instance of a class
