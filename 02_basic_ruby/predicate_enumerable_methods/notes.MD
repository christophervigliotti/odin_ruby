## Notes

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

* Describe what a predicate enumerable method is - predicate method is indicated by a question mark (?) at the end of the method name and returns either true or false. 
* Explain how the #include? method works - This method will return true if the element you pass as an argument to #include? exists in the array or hash; otherwise, it will return false.
* Explain how the #any? method works - It returns true if any elements in your array or hash match the condition within the block; otherwise, it will return false.
* Explain how the #all? method works -  It only returns true if all the elements in your array or hash match the condition you set within the block; otherwise, it will return false.
* Explain how the #none? method works - #none? performs the opposite function of #all?. It returns true only if the condition in the block matches none of the elements in your array or hash; otherwise, it returns false.
