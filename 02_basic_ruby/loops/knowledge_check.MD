## What is a loop and why it is useful?

A loop is code that repeats a block of code.  It's useful to help make code concise 

## What is a loop loop, and how would you use it?

i = 0
loop do
  puts "i is #{i}"
  i += 1
  break if i == 10
end

goes until break

## What is a while loop, and how would you use it?

i = 0
while i < 10 do
 puts "i is #{i}"
 i += 1
end

goes until break...the condition for breaking is stated up front

## What is a for loop, and how would you use it?

for i in 0..5
  puts "#{i} zombies incoming!"
end

These loops are useful if you need to do something a given number of times while also using an iterator.

## What is a #times loop, and how would you use it?

5.times do |number|
  puts "Alternative fact number #{number}"
end

## What is an until loop, and how would you use it?

i = 0
until i >= 10 do
 puts "i is #{i}"
 i += 1
end

until gets.chomp == "yes" do
  puts "Do you like Pizza?"
end

## What are the #upto and #downto loops, and how would you use them?

5.upto(10) {|num| print "#{num} " }     #=> 5 6 7 8 9 10

10.downto(5) {|num| print "#{num} " }   #=> 10 9 8 7 6 5

If you need to step through a series of numbers (or even letters) within a specific range, then these are the loops for you.
